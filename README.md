# TokimonWebServer-Client
- Created a database on a local sever to store object data which the user can look up or augment data. 
- Researched how to implement a REST API to allow the user to interact with the database
- Quickly learnt the syntax and semantics associated with JavaFX to create the user
interface where the user can choose which feature of the database to access
- Implemented the final design of both the client model and server model by following
object-oriented design guidelines
